# Backlog

Peripheral work, unordered. When every item is checked the list is
replaced. The foundations are in `roadmap.md`.

## Open

- [ ] Noun-form audit: modules, structs, and classes read as nouns
  (stdlib and compiler alike).
- [ ] `unsafe` design as an ADR; implementation waits for the package
  suite.
- [ ] Doc-comment collection in the parser (the SSG itself waits).
- [ ] alcy IR text format: define, serialize, deserialize; ahead of
  `--emit=ir` and any cache.
- [ ] Lib packages: the suite's other half next to `[[bin]]`.

## Shipped

- [x] Verb split: `compile` takes a file, `build` a package, `check`
  neither emits. The three verbs each sniffed the target's extension, so
  the sniff lived in three places and `build` carried options for two
  jobs. Designed in `docs/adr/0018`.
- [x] Per-goal configuration under `.alcy/`: `alcy.toml` declares what
  a package is, so build choices moved out of it rather than growing
  beside it. Designed in `docs/adr/0019`.
- [x] Version control option for `new`/`init`: scaffold the ignore
  file for the chosen VCS, never initialize a repository.
- [x] Command result envelope: one output path rendering as text or
  `--json`, with statistics in the text line and the time trace
  embedded alongside it. Designed in `docs/adr/0020`.
- [x] Result lines as a column: counts carry their nouns, sizes scale
  past a kibibyte, and the verb sits at a fixed width so a session's
  results read as a table. A run announces itself before the program
  starts rather than reporting below its output.
- [x] Optimized builds: wire the optimization level through to LLVM
  behind the existing `--release`. The flag reached the object file and
  not the textual IR, because the pass pipeline ran inside the emitter
  rather than on the module; every backend now sees one module.
- [x] Benchmark harness: an engine for the compiler's phases beside the
  process runner, with a local reproducibility check and a CI smoke
  check. Designed in `docs/adr/0021`. Nine of the seventeen phases have
  cases; `load`, `prelude`, and `link` have none on purpose, since each
  is a read, a staging of the embedded suite, or a subprocess, and a
  number for those belongs to the process runner.
- [x] `grammar.ebnf` maintenance: every grammar change diffs the file
  in the same commit.
- [x] `build/scripts` → `tools/` rename, in one shot.
- [x] Samples: `fizzbuzz`, `fibonacci`, and `primes`, run through the
  `exe` harness by `--cases-root` so an example that stops compiling
  fails the build.
